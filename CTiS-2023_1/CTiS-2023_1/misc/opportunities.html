<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
<p>A cyberterrorism attack is intended to cause havoc and create a sense of fear and panic. The act of this attack is considered unethical and illegal however there are opportunities that are created in order to establish procedures for people and businesses to defend against attacks. A large-scale attack is able to influence political instability. This is through holding confidential information and using it to gain political power. This would be beneficial for countries with poorly structured political/governmental systems where they have a dictatorship like hierarchy. A cyberterrorism attack on a place like this may be able to influence the political party for the better of the country. Another potential opportunity that a cyberterrorism attack can create is being able to patch security issues on a network. The more increasing number of attacks, the wearier people will begin to be about potential scams and social engineering strategies. A common example of this is fake news through social media. With the more fake news being published, society is able to recognise this strategy. This therefore would increase the security that individuals will have on a network/software.  
A common cyberterrorism attack that acts as an opportunity for society is attacking those of high stature with malicious intents. An example of this is when a hacker group by the name of Anonymous tried to undermine president Vladimir Putin due to the invasion of Ukraine with attempts to stop the war by declaring cyber war.  </p>
