<p>Our group worked well as a whole; we were each assignment with certain roles that we had to fulfil before the deadlines. We all did an equal part in the assignment and I think we have a good overall outcome in the assignment but that does not mean we did not have our struggles. My first struggle was with the understanding of what to do with my assigned task at the time, i did not know what to do for the risks and choices as I did not understanding what it meant for cyber terrorism because the risk and choices are very broad with our topic, I ended up asking my group for help and we came up with what we all thought it meant, but this was only the first obstacle. I also struggled to get the work done in time, I would often leave my parts I was meant to work until later, nearing the deadlines and would get confused easily with parts of the assignment but my group was always there, we were all there for each other by communicating and having regular meetings, which made us produce this piece of work to a high standard. I contributed equally with me group but at times it felt like I wasnâ€™t, like I would procrastinate the work until a few days until it was due, while worrying at the same time that I will not get it done in time and that I will let my group down so in the future I will need to have better time management and maybe engage with my group more earlier on. </p>
