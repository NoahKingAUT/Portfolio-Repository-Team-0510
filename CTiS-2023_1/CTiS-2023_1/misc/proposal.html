		<td> <em>We are going to be diving into the topic of cybersecurity in terms of Cyberterrorism in the form of Social Engineering strategies. As a team we are going to specifically target America as the cybercrimes that happen there are on a much larger scale but can still relate to any other country. It is important to educate our society and generation on this topic as the future is surrounded by Technology. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and be able to recognize this type of cybercrime. In fact, trillions of dollars are lost every year through cybercrime; not to mention identity theft as well as causing disruption within society due to fake news. Society is able to be manipulated with these social engineering strategies causing disbelief and opinionated topic discussions. Furthermore, we believe this is a valid topic to look in to. <br><br>The reason for us choosing this topic is because everything is going to be online in the near future and the world is moving online at a rapid pace, which means personal details and data will be all online which gives more opportunities for cyberterrorism but also gives more opportunities for cyber security.  </em></td>
