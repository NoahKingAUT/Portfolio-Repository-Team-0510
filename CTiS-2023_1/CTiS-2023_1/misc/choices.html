<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


<p>These risks mentioned earlier can also be prevented with certain choices by the victims of these attacks. Choices such as keeping access on confidential files/databases restricted to only entrusted people, this prevents an internal attack, also updating passwords and cyber security systems often to prevent phishing and physical social engineering. Most social engineering attacks are achievable to the attackers because they exploit the use of lack of knowledge around technology the business/company employs do not have. 
<br><br>
 

  A phishing attack is one of the most common social engineering attacks used by hackers in the U.S, this is because it has a highly effective as most victims fall for it because of the lack of knowledge around cybersecurity “Employees ought to be required to attend initial training during orientation and recurring refresher trainings. This builds awareness by exposing users to commonly employed tactics and behaviors targeted by a social engineer (Nabie Y. Conteh 2015) [1]”, to prevent a phishing attack we need to be aware of what is real and what is fake. To do this you can check the email address of the sender and compare it to the official email address which is found on the official website of that business/company. Also, most company's/business will never ask for money through text, call or email they will get you to do it in their official website/app or in store. This also applies to pretexting as they are very similar, 
  <br><br>
   
  
  Water hole attacks are very common in the U.S, to prevent them be cautious when using third-party sites, try to only using government or trusted entities, if you have to use no trusted/government sites then make sure to keep your work accounts or compute separate from your personal accounts/computer to minimise damage if you end up being a victim to a water hole attack. You should also have an antivirus installed on your computer to monitor the flow of your internet traffic. These are also ways to prevent a water hole attack but the number one way to prevent this attack is by learning cyber security. 
  <br><br>
   
   
  
  Baiting attacks are very common in the U.S and they often get confused with phishing because they are really similar, “Both baiting and phishing are social engineering techniques. The difference between them is that baiting primarily exploits human curiosity, whereas phishing attacks rely largely on trust, fear, and a sense of urgency[2]. To prevent them you should be aware of the number/email of the sender, if it is official or not. if they are claiming you have won something but they need money for shipping or other facts it most definitely is a scam. Usage the attackers will send a link, the link could contain a replica site that is familiar to you making you believe you're safe, to tell if the site is a fake (check the second paragraph). These scams require awareness to be prevented as they rely on the curiosity of the victim. These attacks are more dangerous than phishing because they always want money rather than with phishing where they want money or information. Baiting attacks are more focused on individuals not so much as a company or business. These are some choices to take to prevent a baiting attack but the main way to prevent one is to be educated in cyber security. These attacks only happen because of the choices we make online. 
  <br><br>
   
   
  
  These attacks all rely on the lack of understanding in cyber security, the main ways to prevent all attacks are simply:
  <ul> 
  <li>Only use trust/government sites</li> 
  <br>
  <li>Make sure to keep your work accounts/computer separate from your personal ones</li> 
  <br>
  <li>Have some sort of antivirus/firewall on your computer</li> 
  <br>
  <li>Always confirm emails/messages/phone number with the official ones on the official site that the potential attacker/s are claiming to be</li> 
  <br>
  <li>Social engineering attacks are common in the U.S and in today’s society knowing cyber security is a must because all social engineering attacks are avoidable.</li>
