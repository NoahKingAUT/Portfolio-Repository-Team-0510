<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The risks that come along with having a business/company online that are caused by these social engineering attacks can be prevented with certain choices. Choices such as keeping access on confidential files or databases restricted to only trusted people, this prevents an internal attack, also updating passwords and cyber security systems often to prevent phishing and physical social engineering. Most social engineering attacks are achievable to the attackers because they exploit the use of lack of knowledge around technology the business/company employs do not have. In a ransomware attack the attacker would already have control of the system and will usually demand for money in return for their system back, they might not get there system back to avoid these business/company should have a backup copy of the system and the databases used within it, this copy should also be backup often.<p></h4>
