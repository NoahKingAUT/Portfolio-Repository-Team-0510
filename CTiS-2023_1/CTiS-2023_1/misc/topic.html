<p>Cyber terrorism is the form of deliberating an attack on computer technologies and programs in order to steal information/the details of an individual or organisation. More specifically the areas where cyberattacks are targeted consist of “government computer networks, financial networks, power plants” (Janczewski 01). The hacker has the most benefit to gain out of targeting these areas as they are able to steal secret information or information involving money. With the increasing trend of BYOD, people are more susceptible cyberattacks. 
<br><br>
  

  The discussion of cyber terrorism first began in the 90s during a period of terrorism attacks on the United States  In order to prepare for any cyberattacks, the department of defence issued a test run on their cybersecurity in order to see the limitation within their system[1]. After this test, multiple in-depth studies were conducted around the idea of cyberspace alongside cybersecurity. 
  <br><br>
    
  
  In 1999 a study by the Navel Post Graduate School was published that attempted to establish what would classify as a cyberterrorism attack. The author wrote “terrorist use of information technology in their support activities does not qualify as cyberterrorism[1].” This was done in order to attempt to solidify the meaning of cyberterrorism as around this time was the uprising of al-Qaeda meaning the cyberspace was considered a potential point of attack.  
  <br><br>
  In 2012 a writing was released by Jonalan Brickey that established the definition and outlined the parameters of what cybercrime would be classified as cyberterrorism. An excerpt taken from the writing says “use of cyber capabilities to conduct, enabling, disruptive, and destructive militant operations in cyberspace to create and exploit fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change.[1]” This definition has become more generalised in terms of social engineering attacks are more common due to our society being more technology driven. 
  <br><br>
    
  
  Social Engineering Strategies are a subcategory of cyberterrorism as many are derived from a cyber attack. It is the term used for malicious activities done through human interactions. With an increase in online communicating tools such as email, Linkedln, Discord, etc. creates new elements for social engineering attacks (Krombholz  113) 
  <br><br>
    
  
  There are many forms of common social engineering strategies that can be derived from cyberterrorism attacks. Some common forms of strategies that derive from cyberterrorism include [2] – 
  <br><br>
   
  1. Phishing 
  <br><br>
  A phishing attack is when an attacker sends a user a message through email, SMS or social media. If this message is accessed by the user then it allows the hacker to access their network and therefore access to their personal data.  
  <br><br>
  This type of social engineering strategy has the aim to peak the users curiosity through the message with attempt to lure them into clicking the link. Once the hackers steal the information  
  <br><br>
  An example of an email phishing message include existing account problems where the message will prompt the user to take action in viewing their account. The hacker advertises the message with urgency which result in the victim taking action fast without reading the information thoroughly. The hacker often uses triggers such as recognisable logos/text styles in order to fake the identity of a company to trick the victim.  
  
  Example below: </p>

<p>2.Pretexting  
    <br><br>
  Pretexting is a type of attack that involves a fake identity manipulating someone in return for information. An example of this includes an attack pretending to be a worker at a ISP centre and requesting the victim for information such as account details and passwords. A common example is when attackers pretend to be from the victims back and ask them to confirm their banking credentials. This type of social engineering strategy interlinks with phishing but can be done on any texting media.  
  <br><br>
    
  
    
  
  3. Water-Holing 
  <br><br>
  A watering hole attack is when a hacker will infect a website that their victim is confirmed to visit. When the victim logs into this website, the hacker is able to steal their credentials as well as breach their network and potentially steal more information[3].  
  <br><br>
    
  
    
  
  4. Baiting 
  <br><br>
  Baiting is the form of luring a victim in by promising them a gift/reward. An example of this could include offering them a gift card in return for them filling out a survey. This is presented in the form of a link where the victim is required to click it which could take them to a spoofed version of a login page they may recognise (such as PayPal, twitter or office 365). When the user enters their details, the hacker is able to capture their credentials and use them for malicious purposes.  
<br><br>
  These are common everyday tactics that society falls victim to. Through this, important information is stolen and misused. The importance of this topic is relevant as countries are still in the process of combatting these issues. The U.S has employed around 900,000 people in the field of cybersecurity in order to strengthen the security however they still come out shorthanded due to an increase in cybercrime by 33% in 2022. Therefore; explaining the relevancy of this topic in terms of it still growing and advancing. The online world is moving at a rapid pace leaving more space for cybercrime to occur. Cyberattacks are able to manipulate social media in forms of fake news and emails scams in order to manipulate and influence society while stealing information.
