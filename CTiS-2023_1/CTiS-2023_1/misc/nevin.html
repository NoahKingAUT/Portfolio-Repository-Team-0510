<p>The topic of cyberterrorism raises several ethical issues due to the idea of stealing information, infiltrating networks as well as using social engineering strategies. It involves the breach of sensitive data raising the ethical issue of privacy rights being breached. My reflection of the topic is that it involves several ethical issues and therefore violates framework standards as well as professional code of ethics. These are structures provided to evaluate and understand an ethical issues. In terms of computer ethics it involves rights of privacy and consent when dealing with data.  
    <br><br> 
   

    There are rights to privacy that are set that regard safekeeping users private information. This causes the ethical problem as there is a breach of privacy and security when a cyberattack of this stature occurs and steals confidential information. Another reason where ethics are questioned is the economic harm of an attack like this. Cyberterrorism has consequences of harming businesses causing damages to the economy through financial loss. When the businesses are shut down after an attack which causes a large-scale financial loss where the business no longer has the resources to operate, this raises the problem of unemployment, decrease in job security as well as financial insecurity. There can also be instances of international relation damage if highly confidential information is stolen and used as fuel to begin a war.   
    <br><br> 
    When there is a weakness (holes) within a network or even a software, hackers are able to take advantage of this by planting viruses or gaining unauthorized access. Vulnerabilities like these are what cyberterrorists tend to take advantage off and an opportunity of this is being able to advance the network security. Another opportunity that cyberterrorists exploit is the fact that the cyberworld can be accessed from anywhere. Meaning hackers from anywhere at anytime are able to attack their targets due to the global reach they have.  
    <br><br> 
    All of this harms society along the people of society and can have multiple flow on effects to the likes of poverty and increase in cybercrime. They all question the ethical practice therefore making this a very relevant and important to discuss. There should be high level of security levels in place to prevent large scale cyberterrorism attacks from potentially crumbling our society. The importance of this topic will forever be relevant as society is constantly advancing into a more online orientated world. </p>
    <br><br> 
<p>I personally think this topic should be more focused on in terms of battling cyberterrorism as a cyber-attack on a large-scale level such as this could seriously harm and danger our future. All it takes is someone to gain access to high level information and use it to begin a world war. I strongly believe that we will be seeing more cyberterrorism attacks in the future as more and more of our information/details/money is now all processed online. I also believe that we may begin to see more younger people committing cybercrime as kids during their adolescent years are exposed to the likes of crime through technology. I also believe that those of the older generation who are less advanced with technology will be targeted by cybercrimes as they are more likely to have less secured networks and accounts.

My personal reflection of this assignment was that my group and I were able to be held to a high standard to complete the task. We were able to meet all the due date deadlines. I believe if this assignment were to be done again by our group we would set personal due dates for ourselves to complete task as at times we would complete work last minute. However the assignment was still completed and as a team we communicated well to get it completed to a high standard.  
    
No recommendations. </p>
