<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>A social engineering attack can pose many risks on business or company, a social engineering attack like phishing, internal, ransomware and scareware can ruin a business reputation or ruin the trust between business, major data breaches or compromise disclosed information and minor or major financial loss even the hacks who do these attacks face risk such as legal action taken against them so that they could be fined or imprisoned. There are also some good risks, like how the hacker/attacker could expose unethical practices that the business or organization is doing leading to legal action being taken to the company rather than the hacker or attacks.<p></h4>
