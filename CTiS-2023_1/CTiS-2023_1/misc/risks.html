<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>The risks of Social Engineerinng in Cyber Terrorism 
<br><br>
  A social engineering attack can pose many risks on a business or a company, social engineering attacks like phishing, pretexting, Water-holing, and baiting can ruin a business reputation as well as ruin the trust between businesses. Major data breaches and compromised information and alongside financial loss attacks face the risk of legal action taken against them. This can result in people being imprisoned and fined. However, there are also some good risks, such as how the hacker/attacker could expose unethical practices that a business/organisation is conducting which leads to legal action being taken to the company rather than the attackers.  
  <br><br>
   These risks can also be prevented with certain choices by the victims of these attacks. Choices such as keeping access on confidential files/databases restricted to only entrusted people, this prevents an internal attack, also updating passwords and cyber security systems often to prevent phishing and physical social engineering. Most social engineering attacks are achievable to the attackers because they exploit the use of lack of knowledge around technology the business/company employs do not have.   
   <br><br>
  The risk that the hacker could face is just legal action taken against them. Albert Gonzalez is an example of this, Gonzalez was a cashier to seem normal but he also was a moderator on Shadowcrew.com a website that had databases of stolen card accounts and had information on content such as magnetic strip encoders and card-embossers(device used to read card account information). He had used these devices to steal people's credit card information and would withdraw large amounts of money from their accounts. This would have been one of his first crimes but he was not arrested instead he agreed to help the government, he gained their trust and stayed working for the government for about seven years. But in those seven years Gonzalez and his crew of hackers gained access to 180 million payment accounts from customer databases from many corporations in America. He was caught and had his hearing in March, where he received two concurrent 20-year terms. This was the longest sentence ever given to an American for a cybercrime[6]. This shows that there are risks to making these attacks. He used a social engineering strategy to gain power within the government and was later on convicted. The attack used were an internal attack. Internal attacks can be prevented by making sure that the people who have access to an important system are trusted, in the example, Gonzalez was originally a hacker who had been arrested but had been given access to a system by gaining the trust, this brings up the ethics of second chances, he should of been given a second chance but not given access to those systems.  
  <br><br>
    
  
    
  
   
  A cyberattack such as cyberterrorism can negatively affect a victim in several forms. With risk being; a breach within a network where hackers are able to manipulate as well as steal data. A terrorist skilled enough could be able to hack into a military database and extract top secret and potentially society harming information. A recent case that was classed as a ‘major incident’ involved a cyberattack that breached U.S Marshals Service data. This attack was discovered on the 17th of February 2023. Officials stated that the cybercriminals were able to obtain data about wanted fugitives, personal information on employees and information about third parties. There was also data regarding sensitive law enforcement information. This attack was taken as a serious threat due to the information being able to seriously harm “U.S. national security, foreign relations or the economy, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or the public health and safety of the American people” [2].  The post impact strategy is to go vast measures in order to fill the security flaws within their system. A cyberterrorism attack to this level can heavily impact society. Social engineering strategies could be used with the information in order to cause panic amongst the public depending on what type of information was stolen. It could be information that can expose people of high power causing a governmental crumble. The flow on effects from a social engineering strategy attack could be detrimental.   
  <br><br>
   
   
  
  Social engineer attacks will use multiple attacks in order to maximise damage. 
  <br><br>
  In January of 2023, the US authorities alongside Europol were able to take down the cybercriminal group by the name of ‘Hive Ransomware’. They were first discovered in June 2021 and were believed to be a Russian based organisation. They were successful in their cyberattacks by attacking more than 1,300 companies as well as profiting over $100 million according to a report from U.S agencies [3].  The HIVE was identified as a major threat as they were able to encrypt and compromise information of large IT and oil companies within the United States and of the European union. This included million dollar deals to hack into large corporates[4]. The most commonly affected industries that the HIVE stole from include government facilities, telecommunication, manufactures, healthcare and information technology. Their most known attack was forcing a California healthcare facility to shut down. The HIVE exploited networks by distributing phishing emails with malicious attachments. People would open these attachments without being able to recognise the malicious content and would in turn leave their device vulnerable to attacks [5]. Through accessing the attachment, HIVE were able to access the victims network meaning every device on the network was now accessible to the hackers. The HIVE had social engineering strategies in the way that they attacked large groups of people through these attachments and even at times requested for ransom money. We see that ransom ware was used with phishing leading to a devastating attack on the U.S by cyber terrorist. The risks were that the attacks accumulated over $100 million from the victims, compromised private information from the victims, shut down multiple facilities due to the two previous reasons. We also see that the attackers were taken down which is a risk on the attackers behalf. These acts are harmful to the attacker if they get caught but even more harmful to the victims of these attacks, these attacks all have risks and we need stop these attacks from happening.
